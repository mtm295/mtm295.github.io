    "   The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the steps within the data science pipeline: Data Collection, Data Processing; Exploratory Analysis & Data Visualization; Analysis,Hypothesis Testing & Machine Learning; and Insight & Policy Decision. In this project we gather large blocks of text, in web(HTML) form, and analyze the words that occur and their number of occurances. The mysterious property that language tends to lend itself to, Zipf's Law, shows that the frequency of word occurance is almost always logrithmic. This has been theorized to be a result of how humans have evolved to explain the world around them in a format that is both easy to interpret, yet descriptive enough to the reciever of the information and easy enough to convey as the dissimnator of the information. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   We hope that by analayzing word frequency and the words least commonly used, we can attempt to construct a broad summary of the text. The summary that will be output is at least one word and is compared against synonyms and other related words, in respect to the words that make up the title to see how closely the generated summary matches the article."

    "Zipf's law is an empirical law that is formulated using mathematical statistics. It states that if you are given a large sample of words, and you have a count of the number of occurences for all the words, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you look at a word \"n\", that work has a frequeny proportional to 1/n. So due to this, the word that has the most occurences will occur approximately twice as often as the word with the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third word, and so on. As you go from words with the most frequencies to \n",
    "the words with the least frequency, the occurences will decline exponentially with word length. The theory is that the rank distribution arises naturally out of the fact that word length plays a part. Long words tend not to be very common, while shorter words are. It is easy to see how this has occurred in the evolution of language."
